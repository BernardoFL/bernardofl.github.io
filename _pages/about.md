Hi! I am a 5th year PhD student at the [Department of Statistics and Data Sciences](https://stat.utexas.edu) at the University of Texas at Austin. I am advised by [Dr. Peter MÃ¼ller](https://math.utexas.edu/directory/peter-mueller) and enjoy working on problems at the intersection between Bayesian statistics, biology and healthcare, particularly for computationally intensive problems.

**Research interests**

* Bayesian nonparametrics,
* efficient algorithms for inference in complex models,
* latent factor models
